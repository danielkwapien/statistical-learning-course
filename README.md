# Statistical Learning Coursework

The objective of this course was to:
* Gain familiarity with various data-driven analytical tools for informed decision-making.
* Develop expertise in unsupervised learning for clustering or dimensionality reduction in large datasets.
* Acquire skills in key statistical and supervised learning tools for classification and regression tasks.
* Utilize these models for making predictions, classifications, and drawing inferences.
* Learn to work with the R programming language.

It consited in two projects and a final test. 

## Project 1: Wine analysis

During this project the goal was to perform a data analysis on a dataset and perform PCA and Clustering in order to draw conclusions from it

## Project 2: Bike Analysis

During this second project the goal was to perform again a data analysis and perform a LDA analysis, followed by defining a multiple linear regression model and applying regularization to it.
